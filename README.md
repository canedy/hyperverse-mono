# tribes-Flow

We explored how to use the Hyperverse composable tooling that allows JavaScript developers to interact with the Blockchain easily. During our exploration, we had two primary goals. 

To stand up an instance around our Volunteering Dapp, we could upload our Metadata.
To read information from the Blockchain and interact with our backend database to display additional off-chain Metadata to the user. 

Volunteer Dapp will develop a fundraising application that will allow users to join an organization. Using the Hyperverse Tribes module, we will display the selected organization team schedule.
